		<p class="blog-header">Approaching a New Mentee</p>

		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #1: Be clear about what you&#39;re interested in and can offer.</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">As a mentor, it&#39;s up to you to initiate and introduce yourself to your mentee. I like to have a boilerplate introduction ready to go that I can use to start a conversation.<br><br>
		First, you can start by telling your mentee a little bit about
		yourself: what your major is, what clubs and organizations
		you&#39;re involved in, what your roles in those clubs and
		organizations are, what your hobbies are, etc. <br><br>
		This lets your mentee know what you&#39;re most equipped to
		answer questions about. Most importantly, you should make
		it clear in your introduction that your mentee is free to talk
		to you about anything .</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #2: Find commonalities with your mentees.</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">By far, I think that the most important thing when trying to establish rapport with your mentee is to speak up if you two have anything in common with one another. Interest in sports, music, arts and crafts, academics, etc. I believe that everyone has a passion that they could talk about for at least 10 minutes.<br><br>
		By venturing through several topics and casually talking to your mentee, you increase the chances of helping your mentee feel comfortable enough to share their passion with you, since there&#39;s a large possibility that they may not feel initially comfortable discussing it with you.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #3: Don&#39;t do the 3-Day Rule.</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">Mentees may use either email, texting, Facebook, or some combination of all three (and others) to start or continue a conversation with you. It may be tempting to briefly view the message and tell yourself that you&#39;ll respond later. However, putting off responding often leads to forgetting to respond for hours (or days if you only check social media once a day). Imagine what it was like being an incoming freshman at a huge new university - it can be very discouraging if your mentor doesn&#39;t seem interested in talking to you.<br><br>
		Unless I&#39;m actually busy with work, I normally immediately respond to private messages when I view them. This shows the mentee that you&#39;re interested in the conversation you&#39;re having with them, and it also keeps the flow of the conversation going.<br><br>
		Conversations have a &quot;life-time&quot; threshold between each message where both people are happy and confident in their relationship. If this time is exceeded constantly, then the conversation starts becoming stale and hard to keep up, and your mentee may end up giving up on speaking with you. This is one of the worst case scenarios, as it may lead to your mentee being more reluctant to start a conversation with you in the future.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #4: Skype!</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">I feel like video calling really helps me connect with my mentees a lot better than Facebook chat/messaging because it lets me have a much more complete conversation. It might also be a good idea to suggest getting a coffee (or milk tea!) in person if you&#39;re too busy to maintain an online conversation. Both of these ways require dedicating a period of time just for talking to each other, which is important and can be more helpful than you&#39;d expect.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-header">Top Questions to Ask Your Mentee</p>

		<p class="blog-subtext">A good way to start getting to know your mentee is to start off with breadth questions and move into depth questions. Some popular breadth questions include:
		<ol>
			<li class="blog-subtext">Where did you grow up?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What was your high school like?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What kinds of cuisine do you like?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What are your favorite hobbies?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What are you up to this summer?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What is on your bucket list?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">What kinds of clubs are you interested in joining in college?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">Why did you choose to study [their major]?</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="blog-subtext">From there, I normally go into &quot;question depth&quot;, or asking more specific questions about a particular topic that they show interest in that I can offer more insight into. I find that despite being methodical, this system helps me succeed the best when trying to get to know mentees.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #5: Help your mentee become more aware, not just more informed.</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">I try to answer my mentees questions as fully and honestly as possible, but also take care not to focus on my personal opinions - especially negative opinions. It&#39;s helpful to provide anecdotes, but it&#39;s also important to give context so freshmen have space to form their own opinions.<br><br>
		I also like to help my mentees become more aware of the resources they have/will have for getting additional information (ie. advisors, FCEs, RAs). Most importantly, I try to answer questions in ways that will provide insight, not just empty instructions (ex. &quot;Join Greek life because you won&#39;t have a social life if you don&#39;t!&quot; is not very helpful). <br><br>
		After your mentee gets all of his/her questions out, you could either use this opportunity to prompt them with some questions of your own, or share some of your experiences or tips. Here are some things I like talking to my mentees about:
		<ol>
			<li class="blog-subtext">Procrastination and stress culture</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">The realness of going to the gym at CMU</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">How much does your GPA matter?</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">Trying new things vs overloading yourself</li>
			<li class="blog-subtext">Donâ€™t be scared to ask for help!</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="blog-subtext">Overall I just try to be encouraging. They&#39;re entering a completely new environment, and so it&#39;s natural to have some anxiety and concerns. If it&#39;s something that&#39;s really not an issue, then I tell them that. But if their concern is valid, I think it&#39;s important not to dismiss it, but instead encourage them that they will have the tools and resources to handle it.</p>
		<br>

		<p class="blog-header">Taking Steps Towards a Long-Term Mentorship</p>
		<p class="blog-text"><b>Tip #6: Stay positive and have fun!</b></p>
		<p class="blog-subtext">This one may seem obvious, but I think it's another key reason that good mentor/mentee relationships work out. I think the large majority of people like to be around others that are generally positive (with occasional downs).<br><br>
		The friendships I've built up over the years with incoming freshmen have stemmed from constantly checking up on how they're doing and discussing the ups and downs of my life at that point. I find that this helps people realize that you're human and that you're trusting.<br><br>
		Lastly, remember to have fun! Your mentee, really, is just another one of your friends (although with you likely having a bit more wisdom). Remember to keep in touch with them and don't be afraid to drop a quick line once a week or so, asking them how they're doing and if they'd like to meet up for dinner. Have fun mentoring!
